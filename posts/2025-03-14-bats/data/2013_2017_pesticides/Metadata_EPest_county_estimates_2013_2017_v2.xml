      <abstract>This data release provides estimates of annual agricultural use of pesticide compounds in counties of the conterminous United States, for years 2013-17, compiled by means of methods described in Thelin and Stone (2013) and Baker and Stone (2015). For all States except California, U.S. Department of Agriculture county-level data for harvested-crop acreage were used in conjunction with proprietary Crop Reporting District-level pesticide-use data to estimate county-level pesticide use. Where Crop Reporting District data were not available or were incomplete, estimated pesticide-use values were calculated with two different methods, resulting in a low and a high estimate based on different assumptions about missing survey data (Thelin and Stone, 2013).

Pesticide-use data for California for 2013-17 were obtained from the online Department of Pesticide Regulation Pesticide Use Reporting (DPR–PUR) database (California Department of Pesticide Regulation, variously dated). The California county data were appended after the estimation process was completed for the rest of the Nation.

Estimates of annual agricultural pesticide use are provided as downloadable, tab-delimited files, organized by compound, year, state Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, county Federal Information Processing Standard code, and amount in kilograms (kg). This data release contains estimates of annual agricultural pesticide use for 2013-17 along with associated metadata. This data release is a continuation of the 1992-2009 pesticide-use estimates reported by Stone (2013) and the 2008-2012 pesticide-use estimates reported by Baker and Stone (2015). Tables of annual agricultural pesticide use estimates for 1992-2012 are available for download on the Pesticide National Synthesis Project (PNSP) webpage: https://doi.org/doi:10.5066/F7NP22KM.

Beginning 2015, the provider of the surveyed pesticide data used to derive the county-level use estimates discontinued making estimates for seed treatment application of pesticides because of complexity and uncertainty. Pesticide-use estimates prior to 2015 include estimates with seed treatment application.

Data for some compounds were missing from the version 1 estimates. Pesticide use estimates for compounds with missing data have been updated in version 2.0.

      <purpose>Pesticide-use estimates from this dataset were compiled for U.S. Geological Survey water-quality studies and are suitable for making national, regional, and watershed assessments of annual pesticide use.</purpose>
      <supplinf>For all states except California, pesticide-use data were obtained from proprietary surveys of farm operations within U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Reporting Districts (CRDs). CRDs represent a collection of contiguous counties within a State. The survey data are based on agricultural pesticide-use surveys of farm operations distributed throughout the conterminous United States (Baker and Stone, 2015; Kynetec AgroTrak, written commun., annually 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018). Survey data were used to calculate pesticide use per crop acre, or an 'estimated pesticide use' (EPest) rate, for each pesticide compound used in a CRD. County-use estimates were then calculated by multiplying EPest rates by harvested-crop acres for each pesticide-crop combination in the CRD by year for 2013-17; annual harvested-crop acres were reported by the USDA 2012 and 2017 Census of Agriculture (Ag Census) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014, 2019) and the 2013-16 USDA National Agricultural Statistics (NASS) County Agricultural Production Survey (CAPS) (U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service, variously dated). The methods documented in this report summarize the more detailed methods developed and described by Thelin and Stone (2013) and updated by Baker and Stone (2015).

Two different estimates, EPest-low and EPest-high, provide a range of pesticide-use rates (Thelin and Stone, 2013 and Baker and Stone, 2015) where a pesticide-use rate is not available for a crop from a CRD. Both methods incorporated surveyed and extrapolated rates to estimate pesticide use for counties, but EPest-low and EPest-high estimation procedures differed in how they treated situations in which a CRD was surveyed and pesticide use was not reported (missing) for a particular pesticide-by-crop combination. The EPest-low estimate is assigned a null value (blank) when there is not enough information to determine whether use occurred but was not captured by the survey or whether use did not occur for that pesticide and crop. EPest-high, however, treats missing data for surveyed CRDs as pesticide use likely to occur and therefore calculates a use rate from neighboring CRDs or CRDs within the same region to estimate the pesticide-by-crop use. This method is described in detail by Thelin and Stone (2013). The EPest-high estimate is based generally on the median of reported pesticide-by-crop use rates from surveyed farmers in neighboring CRDs and, in some cases, CRDs within the same USDA Farm Resource Region (Thelin and Stone, 2013). EPest-low annual-use totals can be greater than EPest-high totals when the low method of estimation concentrates the use to a particular geographic area while the high method spreads the use over a larger geographic area. There is uncertainty in both the high and low estimates that is difficult to quantify. A user should become familiar with the two methods to decide which estimate is best for a specific application.

County annual harvested-crop acres reported in the 2012 and 2017 Ag Census (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014, 2019) and 2013-16 CAPS (U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Agricultural Statistics Service, variously dated) were used in this compilation. The Ag Census is the most uniform and complete source of crop-acre estimates for all counties in the United States. The Ag Census is published every 5th year, with CAPS reporting crop-acre estimates for selected crops and counties for interim Ag Census years.

For many crops, CAPS data were not available for any county for the inter-Ag Census period (2013-16). For the 2013-17 estimates, acreages for crops not surveyed by CAPS were interpolated linearly between Ag Census years 2012 and 2017. The 2012 Ag Census data were used in the interpolation; however, the 2012 estimates are not included in this dataset because they are already published in Baker and Stone (2015).

Pesticide-use data for California for 2013-17 were obtained from the online Department of Pesticide Regulation Pesticide Use Reporting (DPR–PUR) database (California Department of Pesticide Regulation, variously dated) and were appended to data for the rest of the Nation after the estimation process described above. Use estimates for California were compiled without extrapolation; therefore, EPest-low and EPest-high rates are the same for counties in California.

        <srccontr>Annual agricultural pesticide use data for counties in California</srccontr>
      </srcinfo>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>For all States except California, pesticide-use data compiled by proprietary surveys of farm operations located within U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Reporting Districts (CRDs)—a collection of contiguous counties within each State—were used to calculate pesticide per crop acre, or an “estimated pesticide use” (EPest) rate, for each pesticide compound used in a CRD.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20190730</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>County-use estimates were then calculated by multiplying EPest rates by harvested-crop acres for each pesticide-by-crop combination in each county with annual harvested-crop acres. County annual harvested-crop acres reported by the USDA 2012 and 2017 Census of Agriculture (Ag Census) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014, 2019) and USDA National Agricultural Statistics (NASS) County Agricultural Production Survey (CAPS) (U.S. Department of Agriculture--National Agricultural Statistics Service, variously dated) were used in this compilation. Estimates were produced using SAS software. 

For the 2013-17 estimates, acreages for crops not surveyed by CAPS were interpolated linearly between Ag Census years 2012 and 2017.</procdesc>

      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Where a pesticide-use rate is not available for a crop from a CRD, both EPest-low and EPest-high estimates were made to provide a range of pesticide-use rates (Thelin and Stone, 2013 and Baker and Stone, 2015). Both methods incorporated surveyed and extrapolated rates to estimate pesticide use for counties, but EPest-low and EPest-high estimation procedures differed in how they treated situations in which a CRD was surveyed and pesticide use was not reported (missing) for a particular pesticide-by-crop combination. The EPest-low estimate is assigned a null value (blank) when there is not enough information to determine whether use occurred but was not captured by the survey or whether use did not occur for that pesticide and crop. EPest-high, however, treats missing data for surveyed CRDs as pesticide use likely to occur and therefore calculates a use rate from neighboring CRDs or CRDs within the same region to estimate the pesticide-by-crop use.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The original dataset was incomplete. Data for select compounds were missing from the original (version 1) pesticide use estimates. Pesticide use estimates were reprocessed following the above steps and pesticide use estimates for compounds with missing data have been updated in version 2.0. Specifically:

1. The following compounds were missing from the original pesticide use estimates for years 2013-17, for states except California. Pesticide use for the missing compounds has been added to the version 2.0 estimates. Note: there are no pesticide use estimates for these compounds for 2017.
AMETRYN, ASULAM, AZINPHOS-METHYL, BACILLUS FIRMUS, BACTERIOPHAGE, CARBOXIN, DISULFOTON, ENDOSULFAN, FENAMIPHOS, FORAMSULFURON, HYMEXAZOL, IMAZALIL, IMAZAPYR, IPCONAZOLE, MANEB, METHAMIDOPHOS, NAPTALAM, PASTEURIA NISHIZAWAE, PENFLUFEN, PINOLENE, SEDAXANE, SUCROSE OCTANOATE, TCMTB, TEBUFENOZIDE, THIAZOPYR, TOLCLOFOS-METHYL, TRIADIMENOL, TRINEXAPAC, TRITICONAZOLE

2. The following compounds had incomplete estimates in the original pesticide use estimates as a result of missing use estimates for sugarcane for years 2013-17. Pesticide use on sugarcane has been added to the version 2.0 estimates for 2013-17.
2,4-D, ATRAZINE, AZOXYSTROBIN, CHLORANTRANILIPROLE, CHLORIMURON, CLOMAZONE, CLOPYRALID, CYFLUTHRIN, CYHALOTHRIN-LAMBDA, DICAMBA, DIURON, FLUBENDIAMIDE, FLUMIOXAZIN, FLUXAPYROXAD, GLYPHOSATE, HALOSULFURON, HEXAZINONE, IMIDACLOPRID, MESOTRIONE, METCONAZOLE, METRIBUZIN, NOVALURON, PARAQUAT, PENDIMETHALIN, PHORATE, PROPICONAZOLE, PYRACLOSTROBIN, SULFENTRAZONE, TERBACIL, TRIFLOXYSTROBIN, TRIFLOXYSULFURON, TRIFLURALIN</procdesc>
