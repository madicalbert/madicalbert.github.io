# Background

Coastal wetlands provide a natural defense against storm surges and the effects of sea-level rise. They act like a sponge that dissipates wave impacts and reduces flood risk. Benefit transfer analysis can be used to determine the value of a 60 hectare salt marsh wetlands in Huntington Beach, California.

# Data

The analysis will pull from these two studies:

-   [Bayraktov et al. (2015)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-1077): a meta-analysis of coastal wetland restoration costs. Specifically, you have access to the mangrove and salt marsh databases.

-   [Costanza et al. (2021)](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4be8afd6872145f585782f6e3f8fbe95): estimate the storm protection benefits (avoided damage).

The dataset of Bayraktov et al. (2015) and has the following information:

1\) study_cluster: research belonging to a specific year

2\) wetland_type: mangrove or saltmarsh

3\) observation: research ID

4\) reference: authors

5\) ref_year: publication year

6\) country: country where the restoration project took place

7\) area_ha: restoration area

8\) total_cost_2010: total restoration cost in USD2010

# Restoration costs

*Employ a benefit transfer to find the costs of restoring 60 hectares of wetland.*

1)  *Inspect the dataset. What wetland type is most appropriate for your analysis? Filter the dataset for that wetland type.*

We want saltmarsh wetlands for our analysis.

2)  *Create a new variable with the restoration costs per hectare. Then, choose one of the research studies and estimate the total costs of restoring 60 hectares in Huntington Beach. Explain your choice.*

To choose a research study, I filtered for projects in the USA with an area greater than or equal to 60 hectares. From these four results, I consulted with the larger data set from the Bayraktov et al. (2015) study to determine that observation #106 was a project in the San Francisco Bay area of California. Because our restoration site is in Huntington Beach, California, I chose observation #106 as the most appropriate for our analysis based on geographic location. Based on the restoration cost per hectare for observation #106, the total cost of restoring 60 hectares in Huntington Beach is \$5,496,801.63

```{r}
#load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

rm(list = ls())

# Load the data
cost_df <- read_csv(here("posts/2024-12-17-benefits-transfer/cost_df.csv"))

# Filter for saltmarsh
saltmarsh_df <- cost_df %>%
  filter(wetland_type == "saltmarsh") %>% 
  drop_na()

# Create a new variable with the restoration costs per hectare
saltmarsh_df <- saltmarsh_df %>%
  mutate(cost_per_ha = total_cost_2010 / area_ha)

# Choose one of the research studies
saltmarsh_df %>% 
  filter(country == "USA") %>%
  filter(area_ha >= 60) 

# estimate the total costs of restoring 60 hectares in Huntington Beach based on observation #106
total_cost_60_ha <- saltmarsh_df %>%
  filter(observation == 106) %>%
  pull(cost_per_ha) * 60
total_cost_60_ha
```

3)  *We are interested in the marginal cost of each additional hectare restored. Make a scatter plot of hectares on the y-axis and total restoration costs on the x-axis in the USA. Describe the relationship between total costs and wetland area restored.*

```{r, fig.cap="Scatter plot of total restoration costs and  hectares of saltmarsh wetland restored in the USA"}
#filter for only USA
saltmarsh_usa <- saltmarsh_df %>% 
  filter(country=="USA")

# Scatter plot of hectares on the y-axis and total restoration costs on the x-axis in the USA
saltmarsh_usa %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_cost_2010, y = area_ha)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_log10() +  # Log transform x-axis
  scale_y_log10() +  # Log transform y-axis 
  labs(title = "Total Restoration Costs by Area of Restored Saltmarsh",
       x = "Total Restoration Costs (USD2010, log scale)",
       y = "Wetland Area Restored (ha, log scale)") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

The scatter plot shows a positive relationship between total restoration costs and hectares of wetland area restored. As the area of wetland restoration increases, the total restoration costs also increases. The relationship appears to be linear, with a few outliers that have higher restoration costs for a given area of wetland restoration.

4)  *Run the following regression: total_cost_2010 = a + b\*area_ha + error. Using the outcome of this regression, recalculate the total cost of restoring 60 hectares of wetland.*

```{r}
# Run the regression
lm_cost <- lm(total_cost_2010 ~ area_ha, data = saltmarsh_usa)
summary(lm_cost)

# Recalculate the total cost of restoring 60 hectares of wetland
total_cost_60_ha_lm <- coef(lm_cost)[1] + coef(lm_cost)[2] * 60
total_cost_60_ha_lm
```

The total cost from the regression is \$3,077,755 to restore 60 hectares of wetland in Huntington Beach. This estimate is much lower than the previous estimate based on observation #106.

5)  *Describe one way you could improve your cost analysis and valuation.*

One way to improve the cost analysis and valuation is to include additional variables that may influence the restoration costs. For example, factors such as the type of restoration activities, the condition of the wetland site, and the availability of resources could impact the total restoration costs. By including these variables in the analysis, we can better estimate the costs of restoring wetlands and provide more accurate benefit transfer estimates.

# Storm protection benefits

[Costanza et al. (2021)](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4be8afd6872145f585782f6e3f8fbe95) analyzed 1288 coastal storms globally to calculate the storm protection benefits from wetlands. The authors obtained the following regression estimates:

$ln(damages/GDP) = -7.992 - 0.236ln(wetlands) + 3.298ln(windspeed) - 0.55ln(speed) + 0.137(volume) - 0.058(time)$

They have the following variables:

-   damages/GDP,

-   wind speed of the storm (windspeed),

-   the forward speed of the storm (speed),

-   wetland area in the swath of the storm (wetlands),

-   the volume of water in the ocean proximal to the storm landfall (volume),

-   and the year of the storm minus 1900 (time) as a (non-transformed) linear variable.

6)  *Interpret the coefficient on ln(wetlands). (Hint: notice that the dependent variable is also log-transformed)*

The coefficient on ln(wetlands) is -0.236. This coefficient indicates that a 1% increase in wetland area in the swath of the storm is associated with a 0.236% decrease in damages relative to GDP. Because both the dependent variable (damages/GDP) and the wetland area are log-transformed, this coefficient captures the percentage change in damages/GDP resulting from a 1% change in wetland area. In other words, a larger wetland area provides greater storm protection benefits by reducing the damages caused by coastal storms.

7)  *Calculate the avoided damage of 60 additional hectares of wetlands in case of a storm like Hurricane Hilary. You have the following information: damages = \$18 million, and the available wetland area today is 72 hectares. Assume the GDP doesn't change (only damage moves), and all the remaining variables remain constant.*

```{r}
#calculate change in wetland 
current_wetland_area <- 72
additional_wetland_area <- 60
total_wetland_area <- current_wetland_area + additional_wetland_area 
# 72 + 60 = 132


ln_wetland <- log(total_wetland_area/current_wetland_area)
# ln_wetland
#log(132/72) = 0.6061358034

#reduction in damages
ln_damages <- -0.236 * ln_wetland
# - 0.236 * 0.6061358034 = -0.1430480496
# ln_damages

#calculate damage
damages <- 18000000  
damage_new <- damages * exp(ln_damages)
#18,000,000 * exp(-0.1430480496)
# damage_new

avoided_damage = damages - damage_new
#18000000 - 15600824 = 2399176
avoided_damage 

```

The avoided damage from 60 additional hectares of wetlands in case of a storm like Hurricane Hilary is \$2,399,176.
