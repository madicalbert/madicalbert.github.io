    "text": "Background\nCoastal wetlands provide a natural defense against storm surges and the effects of sea-level rise. They act like a sponge that dissipates wave impacts and reduces flood risk. Benefit transfer analysis can be used to determine the value of a 60 hectare salt marsh wetlands in Huntington Beach, California.\n\n\nData\nThe analysis will pull from these two studies:\n\nBayraktov et al. (2015): a meta-analysis of coastal wetland restoration costs. Specifically, you have access to the mangrove and salt marsh databases.\nCostanza et al. (2021): estimate the storm protection benefits (avoided damage).\n\nYou have part of the dataset of Bayraktov et al. (2015) and it has the following information:\n1) study_cluster: research belonging to a specific year\n2) wetland_type: mangrove or saltmarsh\n3) observation: research ID\n4) reference: authors\n5) ref_year: publication year\n6) country: country where the restoration project took place\n7) area_ha: restoration area\n8) total_cost_2010: total restoration cost in USD2010\n\n\nPart 1: Restoration costs\nYou will employ a benefit transfer to find the costs of restoring 60 hectares of wetland.\n\nInspect the dataset.

From these four results, I consulted with the larger data set from the Bayraktov et al. (2015) study to determine that observation #106 was a project in the San Francisco Bay area of California. Because our restoration site is in Huntington Beach, California, I chose observation #106 as the most appropriate for our analysis based on geographic location. Based on the restoration cost per hectare for observation #106, the total cost of restoring 60 hectares in Huntington Beach is $5,496,801.63\n\nWe are interested in the marginal cost of each additional hectare restored. Make a scatter plot of hectares on the y-axis and total restoration costs on the x-axis in the USA. Describe the relationship between total costs and wetland area restored.\n\n\n#filter for only USA\nsaltmarsh_usa &lt;- saltmarsh_df %&gt;% \n  filter(country==\"USA\")\n\n# Scatter plot of hectares on the y-axis and total restoration costs on the x-axis in the USA\nsaltmarsh_usa %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = total_cost_2010, y = area_ha)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_log10() +  # Log transform x-axis\n  scale_y_log10() +  # Log transform y-axis \n  labs(title = \"Total Restoration Costs by Area of Restored Saltmarsh\",\n       x = \"Total Restoration Costs (USD2010, log scale)\",\n       y = \"Wetland Area Restored (ha, log scale)\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plot of total restoration costs and hectares of saltmarsh wetland restored in the USA\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot shows a positive relationship between total restoration costs and hectares of wetland area restored. As the area of wetland restoration increases, the total restoration costs also increases. The relationship appears to be linear, with a few outliers that have higher restoration costs for a given area of wetland restoration.\n\nRun the following regression: total_cost_2010 = a + b*area_ha + error. Using the outcome of this regression, recalculate the total cost of restoring 60 hectares of wetland.\n\n\n# Run the regression\nlm_cost &lt;- lm(total_cost_2010 ~ area_ha, data = saltmarsh_usa)\nsummary(lm_cost)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = total_cost_2010 ~ area_ha, data = saltmarsh_usa)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-5239511  -541661  -352808    87971  7111292 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This estimate is much lower than the previous estimate based on observation #106.\n\nDescribe one way you could improve your cost analysis and valuation.\n\nOne way to improve the cost analysis and valuation is to include additional variables that may influence the restoration costs. For example, factors such as the type of restoration activities, the condition of the wetland site, and the availability of resources could impact the total restoration costs. By including these variables in the analysis, we can better estimate the costs of restoring wetlands and provide more accurate benefit transfer estimates.\n\n\nPart 2: Storm protection benefits\nCostanza et al. (2021) analyzed 1288 coastal storms globally to calculate the storm protection benefits from wetlands. The authors obtained the following regression estimates:\n\\(ln(damages/GDP) = -7.992 - 0.236ln(wetlands) + 3.298ln(windspeed) - 0.55ln(speed) + 0.137(volume) - 0.058(time)\\)\nThey have the following variables:\n\ndamages/GDP,\nwind speed of the storm (windspeed),\nthe forward speed of the storm (speed),\nwetland area in the swath of the storm (wetlands),\nthe volume of water in the ocean proximal to the storm landfall (volume),\nand the year of the storm minus 1900 (time) as a (non-transformed) linear variable.\n\n\nInterpret the coefficient on ln(wetlands). (Hint: notice that the dependent variable is also log-transformed)\n\nThe coefficient on ln(wetlands) is -0.236. This coefficient indicates that a 1% increase in wetland area in the swath of the storm is associated with a 0.236% decrease in damages relative to GDP. Because both the dependent variable (damages/GDP) and the wetland area are log-transformed, this coefficient captures the percentage change in damages/GDP resulting from a 1% change in wetland area. In other words, a larger wetland area provides greater storm protection benefits by reducing the damages caused by coastal storms.\n\nCalculate the avoided damage of 60 additional hectares of wetlands in case of a storm like Hurricane Hilary. You have the following information: damages = $18 million, and the available wetland area today is 72 hectares. Assume the GDP doesn’t change (only damage moves), and all the remaining variables remain constant.\n\n\n#calculate change in wetland \ncurrent_wetland_area &lt;- 72\nadditional_wetland_area &lt;- 60\ntotal_wetland_area &lt;- current_wetland_area + additional_wetland_area \n# 72 + 60 = 132\n\n\nln_wetland &lt;- log(total_wetland_area/current_wetland_area)\n# ln_wetland\n#log(132/72) = 0.6061358034\n\n#reduction in damages\nln_damages &lt;- -0.236 * ln_wetland\n# - 0.236 * 0.6061358034 = -0.1430480496\n# ln_damages\n\n#calculate damage\ndamages &lt;- 18000000  \ndamage_new &lt;- damages * exp(ln_damages)\n#18,000,000 * exp(-0.1430480496)\n# damage_new\n\navoided_damage = damages - damage_new\n#18000000 - 15600824 = 2399176\navoided_damage \n\n[1] 2399176\n\n\nThe avoided damage from 60 additional hectares of wetlands in case of a storm like Hurricane Hilary is $2,399,176.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{calbert2024,\n  author = {Calbert, Madison},\n  title = {Benefits {Transfer}},\n  date = {2024-12-17},\n  url = {https://madicalbert.github.io/posts/2022-12-17-benefits-transfer/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nCalbert, Madison. 2024. “Benefits Transfer.” December 17,\n2024. https://madicalbert.github.io/posts/2022-12-17-benefits-transfer/."
