title: "About Me"
---

I am currently a master’s student at UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, specializing in conservation planning. Before graduate school, I worked as a consulting wildlife biologist and botanist, conducting special-status species surveys, botanical assessments, and biological construction monitoring. My experience spans a variety of taxa, including the federally and state-listed California tiger salamander (*Ambystoma californiense*) and California red-legged frog (*Rana draytonii*). I have also contributed to habitat restoration projects focused on invasive species removal and native plant installation.

I earned a B.S. in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in ecology from UCSB. My passion for the natural world was shaped by my upbringing in Valley Center, a small, rural community in northern San Diego County. In my free time, I enjoy birdwatching, botanizing, hiking, and traveling with friends and family.
