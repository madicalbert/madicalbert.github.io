From the Environmental Data Initiative repository: “The Sierra Lakes Inventory Project (SLIP) was a research endeavor that ran from 1995-2002 and has supported research and management of Sierra Nevada aquatic ecosystems and their terrestrial interfaces. We described the physical characteristics of and surveyed aquatic communities for \\>8,000 lentic water bodies in the southern Sierra Nevada, including lakes, ponds, marshes, and meadows.”\n\n## RAMU Abundance by Year and Life Stage (across all lakes)\n\n### Steps\n\n-   Libraries\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(janitor)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n-   Load in the data.\n\n-   Filter for *Rana muscosa* and life stage.

Plot A portrays RAMU abundance by year and life stages (adult, subadult, and tadpole) across all lakes. RAMU abundance increases over the years and the tadpoles account for the greatest number of amphibians across all years. In 2002, there is the greatest number of tadpoles. Plot B portrays RAMU abundance by lake and life stage (adult and subadult combined) across all years, including the top 5 lakes with the greatest species abundance.](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Works Cited\n\nKnapp, R.A., C.
